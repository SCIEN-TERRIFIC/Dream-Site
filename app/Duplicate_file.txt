What is a version control system?
A version control system or VCS, also know as revision control or source control system, is a software utility that tracks and manages changes to a filesystem. A VCS also offers collaborative utilities to share and integrate these filesystem changes to other VCS users. When operating at the filesystem level, a VCS will track the addition, deletion, and modification actions applied to files and directories. A repository is a VCS term which describes when VCS is tracking a filesystem. In the scope of individual source code files, a VCS will track additions, deletions, modifications of the lines of text within that file. Popular software industry VCS options include Git, Mercurial, SVN and preforce.


Why do I need version control software?
VCS is an invaluable tool with many benefits to a collaborative software team workflow. Any software project that has more than one developer maintaining source code files should absolutely use a VCS. Additionally, sole-maintainer projects will also greatly benefit from utilizing a VCS. There is arguably no valid reason to forgo the use of a VCS in any modern software development project.


Pros of Git version control:

Distributed fault tolerant network architecture
Optimized for fast commits and checkouts
Non-destructive updates through use of an immutable log

Cons of Git version control:

Weak support for large binary files
Very large repositories with extensive history can slow down interactions
Learning curve and un-intuitive commands
